# Battleship in C
## Background
I started this project halfway through a C course at UVic (CSC 111) because I wanted to challenge my knowledge of arrays. It is not nearly as optimized as it could be due to not learning structs until after I completed it.

This program is a 2 player text based battleship game that uses typed input to play. Once battleships are oriented and placed using a cartesian coordinate system, players take turns firing upon eachother's ships. Misses are marked with an '*', and hits are marked with an 'X'.
